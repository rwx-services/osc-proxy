# OSC Proxy Configuration Example
# Copy this file to osc_proxy.yml and customize for your setup

# UDP listener configuration
udp:
  port: 8000                    # Port to listen for incoming OSC messages
  bind: "0.0.0.0"              # Interface to bind to (0.0.0.0 = all interfaces)
  max_message_size: 8192       # Maximum OSC message size in bytes

# TCP destination configuration
tcp:
  host: "192.168.1.100"        # IP address of DMX/lighting system
  port: 9000                    # TCP port of DMX/lighting system
  keepalive: true              # Enable TCP keepalive (recommended for WiFi)
  keepalive_interval: 10       # Keepalive probe interval in seconds
  nodelay: true                # Disable Nagle's algorithm for lower latency
  connect_timeout: 5           # Connection timeout in seconds

# Reconnection strategy
reconnect:
  max_attempts: -1             # Maximum reconnection attempts (-1 = infinite)
  initial_delay: 0.1           # Initial delay before first reconnect (seconds)
  max_delay: 5.0               # Maximum delay between reconnect attempts (seconds)
  backoff_multiplier: 2.0      # Exponential backoff multiplier

# Logging configuration
logging:
  level: "normal"              # Log level: quiet, normal, or verbose
  show_message_content: true   # Show OSC message addresses and arguments in logs
